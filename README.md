#Numerical Analysis

This software package allows users to solve both
matrices by using the following methods

1. Jacobi Iteration
2. Gauss-Siedel Iteration
3. Successive Over-Relaxation
4. Gaussian Elimination
5. LU-Decomposition

The user must select the desired method by entering the corresponding
integer.  Matrices are input from text files in the format

rows
columns
Values for matrix a
Values for matrix b

output will be the solution vector x saved to a corresponding .txt file
for example "Jacobi.txt"


Additionally roots of equations can be found by the

6. Bisection Method
7. Regula-Falsi Method
8. Newton-Raphson Method

Equations as well as an initial guess are entered via std input
